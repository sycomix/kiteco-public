    - `macos [x%]`: macos client
    - `windows [x%]`: windows client
    - `linux [x%]`: linux client
    - `backend [release branch]`: backend release (requires release branch)
    - `website`: website
    - `npm`: publish kite's npm package suite (kite-connector, kite-api, kite-installer)
    - `plugins`: publish all plugins
    - `vscode`: publish vs code
    - `atom`: publish atom
    - `binaries`: publically upload binaries
    - `readmes`: copy and push plugin readmes to kiteco/plugins

    NOTE: running a release will always release the *latest staged version* of the items to
    release, save for a few important exceptions:
    - the backend will release the backend deployment given by the *release branch*
    - plugins publish will publish the *latest master* (this is not ideal as differences can emerge
      between testing staging and release)
    - readmes will publish the *latest master readme of atom* (this is because atom is not a
      submodule, therefore to update we need to pull it separately)

    The release branch is outputted by the stage command and looks like `release_[timestamp]`. Make
    sure to double-check the branch name as the backend release will fail if given the wrong branch
    name.
